    <p>The city was ruled by the Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Visakha Varma.[43] Legend has it that Radha and Vi≈õakha were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Visakka Sakhi is the second most important gopi of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert Gopi messenger. Residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Vi≈õakha. This is now inundated under seawater near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named Vi≈õakha. Later it was ruled by Kingdom of Jeypore (1535‚Äì1571), Qutb Shahis (1571‚Äì1674) and (1674‚Äì1711), Mughal Empire (1711‚Äì1724) and Nizam (1724‚Äì1757). The French (1757) and British (1765) established Factories and influence over the city. In 1794 the Battle of Padmanabham occurred between the Zamindari of Vizianagaram and the East India Company.[44] after the battle, Vizianagaram estate was acquired by the East India company in 1802.[45] The British East India Company fought the 1804 Battle of Vizagapatnam and it remained the under British colonial rule until Indian independence in 1947 which was a part of the Northern Circars.</p>
